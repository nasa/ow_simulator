## Overview

OceanWATERS is a ROS-based physical and visual simulation of a lander
on the Jovian moon Europa. It is intended as a testbed to aid in
producing software that could help enable autonomous lander operations
on ocean worlds of the Solar System, such as Europa and Enceladus.

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/nasa/ow_simulator/wiki) for
full documentation. 

See the 
[Release Notes](https://github.com/nasa/ow_simulator/wiki/Release-Notes) 
for a list of feature enhancements in the latest software release.

## Code Organization

The [ow_simulator](https://github.com/nasa/ow_simulator) is the top
level repository for OceanWATERS. It primarily contains ROS/Gazebo
packages related to visual and physical simulation for OceanWATERS. It
also contains workspace files for setting up the rest of the
OceanWATERS repositories:

- [ow_autonomy](https://github.com/nasa/ow_autonomy)
- [ow_europa](https://github.com/nasa/ow_europa)
- [irg_open](https://github.com/nasa/irg_open)

## Getting Started

OceanWATERS requires a Linux computer (Ubuntu 20.04 specifically)
running the Noetic version of the Robot Operating System (ROS).  The
following documents provide detailed information on hardware and
software requirements, and instructions for installing, building, and
running the software.
