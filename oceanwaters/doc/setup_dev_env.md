These instructions cover system requirements, and the installation of
prerequisite software (ROS, PLEXIL, GSAP), for OceanWATERS.  Familiarity with
Unix/Linux and the Bash shell command line is assumed.

System Requirements
-------------------

### Hardware

The minimum recommended hardware configuration is as follows:

-   2.0 GHz quad core x86-64 CPU
-   16 GB memory
-   Nvidia graphics card. GeForce GTX 750-Ti, GeForce GTX 960M, Quadro M1200, or
    better.

### Software

The following minimum software set is required to build and run OceanWATERS
(version numbers and identifiers are listed where specific versions are
required):

-   The Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) Linux operating system, with:
    -   The Bash command shell
    -   The git version control system
-   [ROS Noetic Ninjemys](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic) distribution, with:
    -   The Catkin build system
-   Gazebo 11.12+
- PLEXIL plan language and executive (http://plexil.sourceforge.net).
- Generic Software Architecture for Prognostics (GSAP) v2.0

IMPORTANT NOTE: Virtual machines (in particular VMWare, Parallels, VirtualBox,
Windows Subsystem for Linux v2) have all worked to some degree, but tend to not
support the Gazebo simulator very well or at all. *Virtual machines are not
recommended for OceanWATERS.*


Prerequisites
-------------

OceanWATERS requires PLEXIL, GSAP, ROS, and Gazebo.
In the following instructions, we assume the default command shell is Bash.

### PLEXIL

The OceanWATERS distribution includes an autonomy module
(`ow_autonomy`) that at present uses PLEXIL, an open-source plan
authoring language and autonomy executive developed largely by NASA.
It is hosted at
[*https://github.com/plexil-group/plexil](https://github.com/plexil-group/plexil).

PLEXIL must be built from its source code *prior* to building the
`ow_plexil` package.  This is a one-time step, that may need to be
repeated only when there is an essential update to the PLEXIL software
needed by OceanWATERS, which is infrequent.

1. Check out the `releases/plexil-6` branch of the source code:

```
git clone -b releases/plexil-6 https://github.com/plexil-group/plexil.git
```

Note that at the time of this writing, we used the head of the branch
listed above; it had a git commit hash beginning with `8e990be7`.
This commit has also been tagged `OceanWATERS-v13.0`.  Newer versions
of this branch should continue to work with OceanWATERS, but you can
revert to this version if you run into problems.

2. Install any of the following build prerequisites needed. If you're
   not sure which, if any, are missing on your system, try the build
   as instructed below, and if there are errors that indicate missing
   software packages, install them and try again.  All packages needed
   can be installed with: `sudo apt install <package-name>`.  Here is
   one command to get them all:

```
sudo apt install make \
                 autotools-dev \
                 autoconf \
                 libtool \
                 g++ \
                 ant \
                 gperf \
                 default-jre
```

Note that PLEXIL (specifically the plan compiler) requires the Java compiler and
runtime environment, version 8 or newer.

3. Define the `PLEXIL_HOME` environment variable as the location of
   your PLEXIL installation.  This is needed _prior_ to building
   PLEXIL, and will be needed each time you run PLEXIL, with
   OceanWATERS or otherwise.  Therefore we recommend placing the
   following command (substituting the correct pathname) in your shell
   initialization file, e.g. `~/.bashrc`.

```
export PLEXIL_HOME=/path/to/plexil
```

4. Source the PLEXIL initialization file.  This will also be needed
   every time you run PLEXIL, so we recommend placing this in your
   shell initialization file as well, below the previous command.

```
source $PLEXIL_HOME/scripts/plexil-setup.sh
```

5. Configure PLEXIL for the build.

```
cd $PLEXIL_HOME
git submodule update --init --recursive
make src/configure
cd src
./configure CFLAGS="-g -O2" CXXFLAGS="-g -O2" --prefix=$PLEXIL_HOME --disable-static --disable-viewer --enable-ipc
```

6. Build PLEXIL.

```
cd $PLEXIL_HOME
make universalExec plexil-compiler checkpoint
```

Note that this is a minimal build of PLEXIL as needed by OceanWATERS.
Additional build information is available at the PLEXIL website given
above.


### GSAP

The OceanWATERS distribution includes a power system module
(`ow_power_system`) that uses GSAP, an open-source battery prognostics
engine developed by NASA. GSAP must be installed *prior* to building
the `ow_power_system` package.

1. Check out a designated tag of the source code:
```
git clone -b v1.0.3-OW https://github.com/nasa/GSAP.git gsap
```

This tagged version of GSAP's `master` branch is a tested version of
GSAP for use with OceanWATERS -- newer versions of the branch are not
guaranteed to work.  Note that checking out a specific tag leaves your
local repository in a "detached HEAD" state; this is of no concern.

2. Define the `GSAP_HOME` environment variable as the location of your GSAP
   installation, subsrituting the correct pathname in the following example.

```
export GSAP_HOME=/path/to/gsap
```

NOTE: for convenience, you may wish to add this export to your shell
initialization file (e.g. `.bashrc`), since it is needed every time
OceanWATERS is used.

3. Build GSAP.

```
cd $GSAP_HOME
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

NOTE: Configuration files can be used to tune the prognostics algorithm and/or
adjust the prognostics model used to perform calculations.  An example
configuration file can be found at: `ow_power_system/config/example.cfg`.
Additional information about mapping configuration files and modifying their
contents can be found [here](https://github.com/nasa/GSAP/wiki/Getting-Started).

If you have problems, see additional build information
[here](https://github.com/nasa/GSAP/wiki).

### ROS

Installation of OceanWATERS requires prior installation of ROS Noetic. ROS
binary downloads for Ubuntu Linux are available at
[http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation),
and instructions for installing ROS are available at
[http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu).

* Install ROS (Noetic version) by following
[these instructions](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu). Select the
ros-noetic-desktop-full package when you get to that step.

In the remainder of this document, we assume that ROS has been
installed under `/opt/ros/noetic`.

### Gazebo

* Install Gazebo 11.12+.

  * First run `gazebo --version` and check the version that is
    currently installed, if you have 11.12 or higher installed then
    you may skip this Gazebo upgrade.

  * Add OSRF gazebo repositories to your linux enviroment:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
wget https://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```

  * Update and upgrade the packages (confirm the upgrade when you get prompted):

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
  * Run `gazebo --version` and verify that you have a version of 11.12 or higher.

  * If you may be using Gazebo/OceanWATERS with a VPN (Virtual Private
    Network) running, it is highly recommended you add the following
    line to your shell initialization file (e.g. .bashrc).  An
    explanation of the issue can be found in the [troubleshooting
    guide](https://github.com/nasa/ow_simulator/wiki/Troubleshooting#ignition-transport-failure-on-vpn).

```
export IGN_IP=127.0.0.1
```
